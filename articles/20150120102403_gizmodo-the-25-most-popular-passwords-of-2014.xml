  <p>So a <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2015/01/the-25-most-popular-passwords-of-2014-were-all-doomed/" target="_blank">story from Gizmodo</a> appeared on my <a href="http://feedly.com" target="_blank">feedly</a> page today; listing the 25 most-used passwords of 2014. I thought the list was hilarious. I mean, I'm sure only fairly simple passwords are likely to make a list such as this - any decent password is unique and therefore wouldnt be popular. Still a good chuckle.</p>

  <p>The top ten most-popular passwords of 2014 (according to Gizmodo - sourced from SplashData):
  <ol>
    <li>123456 (Unchanged)</li>
    <li>password (Unchanged)</li>
    <li>12345 (Up 17)</li>
    <li>12345678 (Down 1)</li>
    <li>qwerty (Down 1)</li>
    <li>123456789 (Unchanged)</li>
    <li>1234 (Up 9)</li>
    <li>baseball (New)</li>
    <li>dragon (New)</li>
    <li>football (New)</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  
  <p>As you can see, some good classic passwords are there - 'dragon' is surprising though.</p>
